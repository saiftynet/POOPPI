# POOPPI
Perl Object Orientated Programming Paradigm Illustrations

Perl uinlike many other languages is not short of Object Orientated Programming paradigms.   The classical Package was deemed to be in need of modernisation to bring in the advantages (and possibly disadvantages) of true OOP ideologies along with legibility.  The [Corinna Project](https://github.com/Ovid/Cor/wiki) is one such solution, and the more mature, well-established [Moose](https://metacpan.org/dist/Moose/view/lib/Moose/Manual.pod)/[Mouse](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mouse)/[Moo](https://metacpan.org/pod/Moo) and about a dozen different other ones. As a non-expert  it is difficult to choose which one to learn, which one is best, future proof etc.  Suppose we are going to modernise our existing working modules, can such a transition be benificial or will it bring unnecessary pain?

## Which POOP?
In order to help choose one needs to look beyond the simple illustrations normally provided (the general purpose Person, Point etc that is often demoed)  and  try and use some practical examples.   The objective is to collect practical code examples.

1.  Develop a reasonably complex functioning target program without using any OOP at all, but with a target structure (e.g a hash) to be objectified into a class.  A little bit of cheating is used, in that the subroutines that are linked with the structure are sort of prepped for the next steps.
2.  Convert the code it to use the classic Package  and use the module in a simple clone of that program.
3.  Adapt that to a modern Paradigm...e.g. using Object::Pad.  Ideally would like as many examples of OO systmes as possible
4.  Review and reflect on the ease of use, readability future using Polls for recording public opinions.
